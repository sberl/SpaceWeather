   	    <strong>Bright (active) spots in these images tell you that there is a lot of ultraviolet light being emitted. Dark regions show little activity.</strong></p>
            <p>
       	  <em><strong>Ultraviolet light</strong></em> is invisible to our eyes and has no color as we know it. The image is <u>artificially colored</u> to help scientists know what filter was used. </p>
