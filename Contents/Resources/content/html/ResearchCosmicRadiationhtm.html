							<strong>Definition:</strong><br />
							High energy particles originating from outer space and our Sun. When compared to X-rays or Gamma rays – 
							cosmic radiation cause more biological damage.

						</p>
						<p>
							During our mission to Mars, we will be leaving the protection of Earth's magnetosphere. Earth's <strong><em>magnetic field</em></strong> shields humans from most cosmic rays, but they are common in interplanetary space. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Cosmic rays penetrate most forms of shielding, and so remain a hazard to human health.  Crew who are in space for long periods of time get an increasing dosage of these rays.

						</p>
						<p>
							Each member of the Mars Lander crew has a radiation badge.   The radiation level must be monitored periodically.  

						</p>
						<p>
							One of two readings will occur:  
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong class="green">No radiation exposure</strong> – the radiation sensor will stay green in color, or 
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong class="red">High level of exposure</strong> – the radiation sensor will show bright red. This is an emergency. Contact the MISSION COMMANDER immediately.
