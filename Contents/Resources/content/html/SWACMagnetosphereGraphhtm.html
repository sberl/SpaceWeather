               This graph explains the solar wind's effects on Earth's magnetosphere. When the solar wind magnetic field is opposite the Earth's, it is called a southward field and is considered to be negative in sign. Scientists monitor the ACE data in this graph to identify times when this happens.

                Locate and observe the yellow graph labeled 'Bz'. Each time the yellow line in that graph drops below the dashed white line labeled '0', we know that the Earth's magnetosphere has been affected by the solar wind. Look at the most recent 24 hours of data.

                Use the following levels to determine the peak intensity level of the storm: 
Low (0 to -2) 
Medium (-2 to -4) 
High (-4 to -6)
