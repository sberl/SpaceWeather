							The <strong><a href="event:loadToolCItem('Research','ResearchDeepSpaceNetworkhtm')">NASA Deep Space Network</a></strong> 
							is an international network of antennas that supports interplanetary spacecraft missions. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Continuous 24-hour coverage requires several  stations at locations that compensate for Earth's daily rotation.
						</p>
						<p>
							The locations in Spain, Australia, and California are approximately 120 degrees apart in longitude which enables continuous observation 
							and overlap for transferring the spacecraft radio link from one complex to the next.
