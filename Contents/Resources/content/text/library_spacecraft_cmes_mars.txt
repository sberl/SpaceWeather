			Spacecraft can be affected by the <strong><a href="event:loadCItem('ResearchPlasmahtm','Library')">plasma</a></strong> cloud of electrically charged particles from a <strong><a href="event:loadCItem('ResearchCoronalMassEjectionhtm','Library')">coronal mass ejection (CME)</a></strong>.  The cloud can cause the buildup of electrical charge in metal structures, causing damage to sensitive electronics.

			Cameras could malfunction, communications equipment might be damaged and computer data may be corrupted. Communications with Mars Control could be temporarily affected due damage to a <strong><a href="event:loadCItem('ResearchMarshtm','Library')">Mars</a></strong> telecommunications <strong><a href="event:loadCItem('ResearchSatellitehtm','Library')">satellite</a></strong> caused by a CME.
