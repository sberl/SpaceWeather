					Light radiated by ions and atoms in the Earth's upper atmosphere, mostly in polar regions, the result of bombardment by energetic electrically charged particles from the magnetosphere.

					The aurora is light given off by nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the atmosphere that has been electrically charged by the collision of <strong><a href="event:loadCItem('ResearchSolarWindhtm','Library')">solar wind</a></strong> particles and the Earth's magnetosphere.  They are seen mostly in polar regions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Aurora are more visible after solar storms have been launched at the Earth. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In northern latitudes, the effect is known as the <em>aurora borealis</em>. It is also called the <em>northern polar lights</em> as it is only visible in the sky from the Northern Hemisphere. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Its southern counterpart, the aurora australis or the <em>the southern polar lights</em>, is only visible from high southern latitudes in the southern hemisphere.
