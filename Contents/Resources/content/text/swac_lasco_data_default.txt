	<h1>Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO)</h1>
	<p>
		LASCO is able to take images of the solar corona by blocking the light coming directly from the Sun (the dark circle in the center of the image). The solar disk is indicated by the white circle. A halo effect (like a bubble) seen in a series of images of a solar flare indicates that a storm is coming directly towards Earth.
