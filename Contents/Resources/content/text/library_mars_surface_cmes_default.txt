				Even with heavy shielding the Mars Control station can be affected by the <strong><a href="event:loadCItem('ResearchPlasmahtm','Library')">plasma</a></strong> cloud of electrically charged particles from a <strong><a href="event:loadCItem('ResearchCoronalMassEjectionhtm','Library')">coronal mass ejection (CME)</a></strong> since there is no protection from a strong magnetosphere on Mars.

			<p>
				Robotic spacecraft on the surface could be affected.  Cameras could malfunction, communications equipment might be damaged and computer data may be corrupted. Crews on spacewalks would return to the spacecraft.
