					<strong><a href="event:loadToolCItem('Research','ResearchGeomagneticStormhtm')">Geomagnetic storms</a></strong> can induce electrical currents in the ground creating power surges.  These can damage electrical transmission equipment (generators and transformers) in power grids worldwide. 
				</p>
				<p>
				In 1989 the electrical supply was cut off to over 6 million people for 9 hours in Canada and the northeastern U.S. due to a huge geomagnetic storm. 
				</p>
				<p>
By receiving warnings power companies can minimize damage to equipment by disconnecting transformers or by creating temporary blackouts.
