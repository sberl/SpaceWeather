					<strong>More Information:</strong><br />
					A <strong><a href="loadToolCItem('Research','ResearchCoronalMassEjectionhtm')">coronal mass ejection (CME)</a></strong> is a cloud of electrically charged particles ejected from the Sun.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a CME is headed in the direction of the Earth or a spacecraft, it can cause the buildup of electricity in metal structures on a spacecraft and can also damage sensitive electronics.
				</p>
				<p>
					A CME interacts with the Earth's magnetic field creating a geomagnetic storm and can produce visible aurora.  
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong><em>Geomagnetic storms</em></strong> can damage electrical circuits in satellites and create currents in the ground affecting electrical power grids. 
				</p>
				<p>
					There is little or no radiation risk to humans on the Earth, as the <strong><em>Earth's atmosphere</em></strong> offers excellent protection to life on Earth from a CME.
