	The aurora is light given off by nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the atmosphere that has been electrically charged by the collision of <em><strong>solar wind</strong></em> particles and Earth's magnetosphere. </p>
	<p>
	Aurora are more visible after <em><strong>solar storms</strong></em> have been launched at Earth. </p>
