	<h1>GOES X-Ray Flux</h1>
	<p>
		The solar x-ray activity scale determines the intensity of a solar storm.  A is the lowest level, B is 10 times more powerful than A, C is 10 times more powerful than B, M is 10 times more powerful than C, and X is 10 times stronger than M. So this makes an X event 10,000 times stronger than A.  An X-class event is often a CME.
