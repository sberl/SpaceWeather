	<h1>Coronal Mass Ejection Emergency Procedures</h1>
	
	<p>
		If a <strong><a class="researchLink" href="event:loadCItem('ResearchCoronalMassEjectionhtm','Library')">coronal mass ejection (CME)</a></strong> (a cloud of electrically charged particles) passes by a spacecraft, it can cause the buildup of electricity in metal structures and damage sensitive electronics.
	</p>
	<p>
		A CME interacts with Earth's magnetic field creating a <strong><a href="event:loadCItem('ResearchGeomagneticStormhtm','Library')">geomagnetic storm</a></strong> that can damage electrical circuits in satellites and create currents in the ground affecting electrical power grids. 
	</p>
	<p>
	 There is little or no radiation risk to humans on Earth, as <strong><a href="event:loadCItem('ResearchEarthAtmospherehtm','Library')">Earth's atmosphere</a></strong> offers excellent protection to life on Earth from <strong><a href="event:loadCItem('ResearchSpaceWeatherhtm','Library')">space weather</a></strong>.
