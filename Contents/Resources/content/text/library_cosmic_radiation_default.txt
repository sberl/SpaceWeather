					During our mission to Mars, we will be leaving the protection of Earth's magnetosphere. Earth's <strong><em>magnetic field</em></strong> shields humans from most cosmic rays, but they are common in interplanetary space. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Cosmic rays penetrate most forms of shielding, and so remain a hazard to human health.  Crew who are in space for long periods of time get an increasing dosage of these rays.

				</p>
				<p>
					Each member of the Mars Lander crew has a radiation badge.   The radiation level must be monitored periodically.  

				</p>
				<p>
					One of two readings will occur:  
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong class="green">No radiation exposure</strong> &ndash; the radiation sensor will stay green in color. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong class="red">High level of exposure</strong> &ndash; the radiation sensor will show bright red. This is an emergency. Contact the MISSION COMMANDER immediately.
