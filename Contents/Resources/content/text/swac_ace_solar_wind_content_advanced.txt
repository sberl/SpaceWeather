	<p>
		The graph shows the solar wind's effects on Earth's magnetosphere. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Each time the yellow line in the graph drops below the dashed white line labeled '0', we know that our magnetosphere has been affected by the solar wind. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Look at the most recent 6 hours of data and locate the lowest points on the graph.
	</p>
	<p>
		Use the following levels to determine the intensity of the storm: 
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Low (0 to -2)</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Medium (-2 to -4)</strong></li>
			<li><strong>High (-4 to -6)</strong></li>
		</ul>
	</p>
