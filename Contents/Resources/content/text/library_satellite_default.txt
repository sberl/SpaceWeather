					<strong>More Information:</strong><br />
					Anything that orbits something else is a satellite. The Moon orbits the Earth, therefore the Moon is a satellite of the Earth.
				</p>
				<p>
					The word satellite also refers to a man-made device that is launched by a rocket and placed in orbit around a planet or other heavenly body. These satellites are used for astronomical observation, weather forecasting, television broadcast, amateur radio communications, Internet communications, and the Global Positioning System (GPS).
				</p>
				<p>
					Some satellites are located in geostationary orbits around the Earth, or at <strong><a href="event:loadToolCItem('Research','ResearchLaGrangePointshtm')">Lagrange points</a></strong> in space, in that they allow an object to be in a "fixed" position in space rather than an orbit in which its relative position changes continuously.
