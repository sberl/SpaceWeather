		The red line on the graph indicates the level of solar activity. Scientists have created a scale to help determine if a CME has occurred.

	<p>
		Use the scale to determine the power of the solar storm.

	<ul>
		<li>A is the lowest level</li>
		<li>B is 10 times more powerful than A</li>
		<li>C is 10 times more powerful than B</li>
		<li>M is 10 times more powerful than C</li>
		<li>X is 10 times stronger than M</li>
