				<p>
					Meteor showers are minefields of debris found in the inner solar system shed by comets as they pass by the Sun. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Comet dust and debris become meteors when they hit Earth's atmosphere and are seen at night shooting across the sky.
				</p>
				<p>
					This debris can be harmful to spacecraft travelling in Earth orbit and through space.

					<strong>
						Solar panels on the outside of the spacecraft are the most vulnerable to impact.

				<strong>SPACECRAFT PROTECTION</strong>

				Many different shields protect the crew and spacecraft from impacts.
			</p>
			<p>
				Protective blankets are made of a ceramic fabric backed by Kevlar, the same material found in bullet-proof vests.
