					<strong>Definition:</strong><br />
				Solar Cycle (or Sunspot Cycle) &ndash; An irregular cycle, averaging about 11 years in length, during which the number of <strong><em>sunspots</em></strong> (and their associated outbursts) rises and then drops again. Like the sunspots, the cycle is probably magnetic in nature, and the polar <strong><em>magnetic field</em></strong> of the Sun also reverses each solar cycle.

				<p>
					Changes in the activity of the Sun occur in approximately <u>eleven-year cycles</u> during which the number of sunspots (and <strong><em>solar storms</em></strong>) rises and then drops again. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The cycle is probably magnetic in nature as the polar magnetic field of the Sun reverses each solar cycle. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Solar Maximum</strong><br />
					The month(s) during the solar cycle when the average sunspot numbers reaches a maximum. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Solar Minimum</strong><br />
					The month(s) during the solar cycle when the average sunspot numbers reaches a minimum.
