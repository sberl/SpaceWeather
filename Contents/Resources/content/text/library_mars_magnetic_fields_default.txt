					This is a map of the <strong><em>magnetic field</em></strong> of Mars observed by the Mars Global Surveyor satellite. <br /><strong>Which areas have the most intense magnetic fields?</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Red and blue stripes represent magnetic fields with opposite directions. Darker hues represent more intense magnetic fields. 
				</p>
				<p>
					If the area is located below the equator (zero degrees latitude) it is located in the southern hemisphere, if it is above the equator it is in the northern hemisphere.
