					<strong>Definition:</strong><br />
				A fast outflow of hot gas in all directions from the upper atmosphere of the <strong><em>Sun</em></strong> ("solar corona"), which is too hot to allow the Sun's gravity to hold on to its gas. Its typical velocity is 400 km/sec, covering the distance from Sun to Earth in 4-5 days.

					<strong>More Information:</strong><br />
					The Sun emits visible light, of course, but also infrared and ultraviolet 'light' as well as radio waves, x-rays, gamma rays and cosmic rays. All of these forms of <strong><a href="event:loadToolCItem('Research','ResearchRadiationhtm')">radiation</a></strong> are related to what we know of as 'light' - only, the wavelength is different. <br />

				<p>
					In addition to 'light' the Sun sends out high-speed particles known as the solar wind. Made up of <strong><a href="event:loadToolCItem('Research','ResearchPlasmahtm')">plasma</a></strong>, a mixture of protons and electrons, the solar wind can be charged and affect the magnetic field of the Earth.
