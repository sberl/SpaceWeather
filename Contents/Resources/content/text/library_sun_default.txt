					The Sun is a star at the center of our Solar System. It has a diameter of about 109 times that of Earth. 
					About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen, while the rest is mostly helium. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The Sun's atmosphere stretches beyond the orbit of Pluto, and is called the heliosphere. 
					The Sun is 4.6 billion years old. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The core of the Sun is 15 million degrees, creating a process called fusion where hydrogen atoms are fused together 
					to create helium (a process that has not been duplicated on Earth).
