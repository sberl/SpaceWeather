	<p>
		These are audio files of solar radio bursts produced by two intense X-class CMEs.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Compare the X17 level CME with an X28 level by clicking on each of the two audio files.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Since the ear cannot hear frequencies in this range, the frequencies have been shifted down so that you can hear the emission. The 4-hour duration of the recordings have been shortened to 15 seconds to reduce the length.
