	<h1>About The GOES Satellite</h1>
	<p>
		Scientists monitor the Sun using data from the Earth-orbiting Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) weather satellite spacecraft.  X-rays are continually emitted from the Sun. However, detecting increases in the intensity of those x-rays can provide an early warning of a solar storm.  The GOES satellite detects x-rays emitted from solar flares and CMEs.
