	<h1>Meteor Shower Emergency Procedures</h1>
	<p>
		<strong>All space debris can be harmful to spacecraft travelling in Earth orbit and through space.</strong>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Meteor showers are minefields of debris found in the inner solar system shed by comets as they pass by the Sun.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<strong>Exposed solar panels on the outside of the spacecraft are the most vulnerable to impact.</strong>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Solar panels can be turned away from the Sun so that the thin edge is facing the incoming debris and that a much smaller surface is exposed for a short period of time while the Spacecraft runs on battery power. 
</li>
	</ul>
