	<h1>MARS AURORA DATA</h1>
	<p>
		The small magnetic fields on Mars are impacted by the solar wind and during coronal mass ejections emit faint aurora seen only in the ultraviolet and invisible to the human eye.
	</p>
	<p>
		They can be detected as a spike in the data from orbiting spacecraft. The Mars Express spacecraft has detected aurora in areas where there are remnant magnetic fields.
