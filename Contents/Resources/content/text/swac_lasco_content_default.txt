	<h1>The Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO)</h1>
	<p>
		This set of images was taken by the SOHO spacecraft. LASCO blocks out the Sun to show more clearly the solar corona.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong><em>
		Do you observe any solar flares leaving the surface of the Sun?<br />
		Do you see a halo effect (like a bubble) in the image series?
		</em></strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		This indicates that a storm is coming directly towards Earth.
